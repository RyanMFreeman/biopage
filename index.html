        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I am currently pursuing an associate's degree in Software Development and have developed a diverse skill set over the years.
                With 7-8 years of experience in building and troubleshooting computers and software, I possess a strong foundation in technical support, desktop support, and software troubleshooting. My programming skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, which I continue to improve during my time at Mid-State.
            </p>

            <p>Throughout my short stint as an adult so far, I have honed my management and customer service skills, with two years of management experience in both remote and in-person settings. As a Front End Team Lead at Walmart, I successfully managed a team of over 35 personnel, ensuring efficient workflow and exceptional customer service.
                My role involved performing daily back-end accounting tasks and coordinating schedules and breaks to optimize productivity.
            </p>

            <p>In my previous positions at Walmart, I developed strong customer service skills, often being the first point of contact for customers.
                As a Cap 1 Associate, I was responsible for ensuring top stock was efficiently organized and assisting with truck unloads.
                My experience as a Deli/Bakery Associate required proficiency in time management and the ability to adapt quickly to various tasks, demonstrating my flexibility in fast-paced environments.
            </p>

            <p>With a strong work ethic and a commitment to continuous learning, I am dedicated to leveraging my skills in software development and technical support to make a positive impact in my future endeavors.
                I have a solid understanding of Microsoft 365 and a variety of operating systems, including Windows and Linux. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am always eager to take on new challenges.</p>

            <p>If I'm not working on a school project, or personal one, I am often times writing music or playing games. I have a huge passion for music, and have been playing guitar for 8 years and counting. Through those 8 years I have picked up enough audio engineering tips and tricks to
                record my own music from scratch as a one man band. Thank god for the internet. I also have a passion for games. Specifically RPGs, FPS games, etc. Lately, I've been donating my sanity to Rainbow Six Siege, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get it back.
            </p>

                    <p>I created a simple password manager using Python, and some simple modules like cryptography, and CustomTkinter. It tracks your username, password, and the app/site it belongs to. Then it stores all of that info into an encrypted .json file that is created after running the app. </p>

                    <p>I also ported that password manager from PC to Android using Kivy and Buildozer on an install of Kubuntu 22.04</p>

                    <p>I made a simple Discord bot that I deployed in my personal server. Users can interact with it and either play with eachother through the bot, or the players can initiate a match with the bot itself.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/RyanMFreeman/Win11-Debloat-Tool" target="_blank">Windows 11 Debloat Tool ➥</a>
                    <p>This was my first Python script outside of class. My goal was to target and delete bloatware within a fresh install of Windows 11. It mostly achieves that, but misses a few programs.
                    This is a script I definitely intend on revisiting in the future.
